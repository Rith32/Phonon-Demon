With the aim to apply the demon algorithm in the study of phonon transport with the intent of understanding heat conduction in nanoscale devices, this code provides a simulation of the algorithm in both an ideal gas condition as well as an Einstein solid condition. Each code produces a fit, including a linear and exponential fit to find correlations between demon energy and temperature, to demonstrate the system's movement towards a thermal equilibrium.
